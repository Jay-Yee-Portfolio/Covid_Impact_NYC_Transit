# Covid_Impact_NYC_Transit

Utilized NYC's [MTA turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) to understand the impact Covid-19 had on subway ridership on a station level. The results were used to recommend to a fictional real estate firm which boroughs and stations had high foot traffic and were good areas to start new multifamily developments. 

Data was pulled from March-September 2019 & 2021 to get consistent time periods that also took cylical aspects of public transport into consideration (i.e. seasonality, holidays, etc.). Additionally, the March start date coincided with the national rollout of the Covid-19 vaccines to the general public and reopening of NYC.
